👋 Hi, I'm Sharika!
I'm a sophomore at Barnard College of Columbia University, pursuing a major in Computer Science. I'm passionate about app development and website building, and I also love art such as painting, graphic designing, and Do-It-Yourself (DIY) projects. Additionally, I love fashion and enjoy designing and building creative experiences, as well as being involved in the full production process from concept to market. The intersection between art, fashion, finance, and technology intrigues me; I am open to roles in UX/UI design, product management, front-end development, or product development where I can continue to build new solutions for an easier and more affordable life using my creativity.
